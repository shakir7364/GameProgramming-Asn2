# Game Programming Assignment 2
This assignment builds upon the last one by adding UI elements and sound effects to the previous 2D game project. My main takeaways from this project are the simple health bar and canvas object.

To run the game, open the build folder and run the Assignment2.exe file. However, to exit the build of the game, you will have to close the program manually which you can do from either the taskbar or task manager.

To view the project in the Unity editor, open the Assignment2 folder using UnityHub to open it as a project.
